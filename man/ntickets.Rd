\title{Optimal tickets to sell with overbooking}
\usage{
ntickets(N, gamma, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{integer seats on the plane.}

\item{gamma}{numeric in (0, 1); allowed probability of overbooking (e.g., 0.02).}

\item{p}{numeric in (0, 1); probability a ticketed passenger shows (e.g., 0.95).}
}
\value{
A named list with elements \code{nd}, \code{nc}, \code{N}, \code{p}, \code{gamma}.
}
\description{
Computes the optimal number of tickets to sell when a flight has N seats,
show-up probability is \code{p}, and overbooking risk tolerance is \code{gamma}.
Returns the discrete solution (binomial) and the normal-approximation solution,
and draws both objective plots.
